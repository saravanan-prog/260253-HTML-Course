What is HTML?
=============

    👉 HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages.
    👉 It tells the browser:

         " What content to show
           How the content is structured "


       👉   HTML is not a programming language
       👉   It is a markup language
       👉  It uses tags like <h1>, <p>, <a>





Document Object Model : 
======================

       DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
       It represents a web page as a tree-like structure of objects, where:

         👉  Each HTML element becomes a node
         👉   JavaScript can access, modify, add, or delete these nodes
         👉  The browser creates the DOM when the page loads

               │
               └── html
                  │
                  ├── head
                  │   └── title
                  │       └── "My Page"
                  │
                  └── body
                     ├── h1
                     │   └── "Hello"
                     │
                     └── p
                           └── "Welcome to DOM"
